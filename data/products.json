He is polite to Judy Hopps and speaks quite professionally, which makes him sound more intelligent than he looks. Flash seems to be well acquainted with Nick Wilde and speaks to him in his casual, friendly way.\r\n\r\nHe willingly helps Judy, but can be easily distracted, as seen when Nick interrupts Flash's work to tell him a joke; Flash enjoys jokes, finding them hilarious. He even goes so far as to retell them to his co-worker, Priscilla Tripletoe."},{"id":4,"category_id":"1","name":"Tesla Phone","image_path":"uploads\/tesla.png","description":"A phone with all the advanced tech described below would cost more than a few thousand dollars. Subsequent versions could come down in price as more people start using the technology, but we wouldn't expect the first iteration to be affordable for most people.\r\n\r\nAssuming the phone is real (again, we don't think so) and that it would start relatively basic with just a few of the rumored features, it'd likely sit at a more sensible $800-$1,200."}]
